# cocktailApp V2
**Pick Your Poison - a cocktail recipe app**
*General Assebly Section 2 Project*

**Video Overview:**
https://youtu.be/iJO9loF0Ve0
Overview starts with a quick look at the code. 

**Technical Notes:**
  This project was written with an MVC file structure. This allowed me to evenly spread out my files & code in a way that was both functional and organized.

  **Languages Used:** 
  html, Java Script, EJS, PSQL (In later versions I would like to include CSS)

  **Middleware Used:**
  nodemon, morgan, express, body-parser, method-override, path, pg-promise


**Additional Notes:**
This project was designed to test our MVC file structures, PSQL, middle-ware (Express mostly), EJS, database, & server construction knowledge. 
And, boy did it.
CocktailApp V2 is version 2 of my project. The first version of this app was too involved for this short of a turn around. So, for my first predominately back-end project, I was forced to pair down and minimize.
Version 2 is incomplete, but can be found HERE: https://github.com/ecostey/cocktailApp/tree/master
